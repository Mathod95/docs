**CAPA exam isn’t easy**, but it’s absolutely doable if you go in with the right preparation.

I’ve been using **Argo CD** at work for a while, but the CAPA exam isn’t just about Argo CD. It covers **Argo Workflows**, **Rollouts**, and **Events** too. If you don’t work with those day to day, you’ll need to put in extra study time.

This post is just what worked for me, what didn’t, and how I would approach it if I were starting again.

## The Exam Format

Expect **at least 60 multiple choice questions**. I don’t think that number changes, and they hit *all* parts of the Argo ecosystem.

**Work experience helps, but won’t carry you all the way.** I used Argo CD regularly in my job. **Workflows, Events, and Rollouts?** I had to learn those on my own.

## Study Resources That Actually Helped

At the time of this writing, there’s no fancy KodeKloud course for this yet. Here’s what worked for me:

## 1️ — Killerkoda Scenarios (Highly Recommend)

Do *all* of these, especially if you don’t touch Argo much in your day job:## [argoproj | Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/argoproj?source=post_page-----69075cfdb512---------------------------------------)

Open source tools for Kubernetes to run workflows, manage clusters, and do GitOps right.

They won’t cover *everything*, but they’ll help understand how Argo actually works at the CLI/UI level, which is good for memory retention when answering questions.

## 2 — gitops-with-argocd Course from Kodekloud

It’s not built specifically for the CAPA, but it gave me a **solid grasp on core GitOps workflows** using Argo CD. If you feel weak on fundamentals, start here.## [GitOps with ArgoCD](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/gitops-with-argocd?source=post_page-----69075cfdb512---------------------------------------)

GitOps is a framework where the entire code delivery process is controlled via Git and can fully manage infrastructure…

## 3 — Udemy CAPA Practice Exam Course

The questions are **way easier than the real exam**. Don’t expect to memorize your way through CAPA using these. Use them to **spot weak areas** and **test your understanding.**

## 4 — The Documentation

I know. Reading docs feels like homework. But this is one of those exams where **knowing the official docs structure helps**. Sometimes I could “visualise” where in the doc the answer was just because I had spent time in them before.

Also, this excellent reference with links and key information:

## During the Exam

**Time is more than enough.** I finished early and reviewed what I could.

If you get stuck, **mark it, move on**, and come back later. Sometimes you’ll answer another question that triggers the answer to one you flagged earlier.

**Schedule your exam for the morning**. Fresh brain, fresh eyes, better results.

## Final Thoughts

If you use Argo CD in your job already, **you have a good start**. But don’t skip studying the other parts of the project — **Workflows, Events, and Rollouts.**

Good luck if you’re taking it soon — and if you fail, regroup, relearn, rebook. No shame in that.
