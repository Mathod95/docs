There was a period in time where I was obsessed with using Linux window managers such as [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/). After a while i grew to hate using these types of window managers because they focus too much on DIY and i also enjoy the pretty design of MacOS.

My MacBook only has 8GB of ram so when doing things like having multiple VSCode instances open, the performance really starts to tank so I started to focus more on terminal based software due to them using less memory. This is where i found Zellij, where i can get all the advantages of a tiling window manager while still using MacOS. It makes a lot of sense because the main applications you would want to tile anyway are things like text editors, not browsers.

## Better Keybindings

**Unlike Tmux, the default keybindings of Zellij are much kinder to new users**. When I was learning Tmux i was constantly having to google how to do basic things.

Zellij on the other hand, embeds the keybindings into the UI in a non intrusive way.

## Nicer Design

**The default design of Zellij also in my opinion looks far better, adhering to similar design choices of Linux ricers with gaps in between the windows.**

## Zellij is made in Rust!

Another win for team Rust. Following the hilarious trend of rewriting all common applications in Rust.
