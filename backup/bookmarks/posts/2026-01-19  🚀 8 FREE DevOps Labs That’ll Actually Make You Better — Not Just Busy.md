When attempting to get into DevOps or enhance what you already have, free or low-cost alternatives are as good as the ones that are expensive.

You basically require practical, real-world labs that provide hands-on experience — and not some kind of school pass that gives you activities that seem out of this world.

This list is suitable for you who have been spending time without getting any meaningful result by watching passive videos. It will present you a list for you to make the desired progress.

Here are 8 FREE DevOps labs that delivered more to me as regards my confidence level than the dozen or more Udemy courses combined:

## 1\. KodeKloud Engineer Platform

**Level up like a real engineer** — not just a student. This platform gamifies your DevOps journey. You’ll take on real-world tasks in a simulated production environment and get “promoted” from SysAdmin → DevOps Engineer → Architect as you progress.
