# Introduction

## Chapter Overview and Objectives
In this chapter, we delve into Argo Rollouts, a pivotal tool within the Argo suite, designed specifically for Continuous Delivery (CD) and GitOps practices. Argo Rollouts can be used as a stand-alone tool and therefore does not require any prior knowledge of ArgoCD (or other Argo-related tools). Through thematic discussions and hands-on labs, we aim to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of Argo Rollouts’ architecture, installation, and usage.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Understand and differentiate various Progressive Delivery patterns and decide when to use which.
Have a thorough understanding of what Argo Rollouts is and in what scenarios it might help.
Have an overview of Argo Rollouts architecture and functionality.
