# Introduction

## Chapter Overview and Objectives
In this chapter, we will explore the details of Argo Workflows, an extension of Argo, a popular GitOps tool designed for declarative continuous delivery of Kubernetes applications. Argo Workflows allows you to define and manage complex workflows as code, providing a way to orchestrate and automate multi-step processes within the Kubernetes environment.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to comprehend the basics and architecture of Argo Workflows. This involves understanding its key components, how they interact, and the fundamental concepts that govern the execution of workflows. Here are learning objectives for gaining proficiency in Argo Workflows:

- Define and explain the structure of an Argo Workflow.
- Recognize key elements such as metadata, spec, entrypoint, and templates.
- Understand the role of templates in workflows.
- Identify and explain the primary components of Argo Workflows, including the Workflow Controller, and UI.
- Understand how Argo Workflows schedules and executes tasks.
