**Kubernetes** has a large rapidly growing ecosystem. It is a type of **open-source platform** for **automating tasks, deployments, and management of containerized applications**. **Kubernetes** is an **extensible**, **portable tool** that is used for **managing workloads** and services that facilitate both **declarative automation** and **configuration**.

Multiple businesses use **Kubernetes** to federate and manage **passwords**, **tokens**, and many more. Therefore in this article, comprehensive knowledge has been provided about **Kubernetes** and the **top 10 Kubernetes tools that will be used in 2024.**

## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** is mainly known as **K8s** which is used to manage the **containerized apps** all across **public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.** Kubernetes primarily offers a robust set of features of **container orchestration** such as **self-healing, rolling updates, and automatic scaling.** The main purpose of using Kubernetes is to automate the operational task of container management. Various organization uses Kubernetes to manage microservice architectures.

## 10 Best Kubernetes tools to use in 2024

Multiple **Kubernetes** tools are used to do various things like **managing passwords, tokens, microservice architectur** e, and so on. Therefore some of the 10 best Kubernetes tools which be used in 2024 are mentioned below:

**kubecost** is a popular **Kubernetes tool** that is used to track the Kubernetes costs across **multiple cloud providers** including the **Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure**, and so on. The main advantage of kubecost is it allows the users to see allocated spending all across the native Kubernetes concepts.

**Key Features:**

- kubecost mainly provides **real-time cost visibility** and information for the team which is using **Kubernetes**.
- This tool helps to continuously reduce cloud costs.
- It also provides the right sizing recommendation to quickly target and optimize the over-provisioned resources.

## 3\. Prometheus

**Prometheus** is another famous **open-source monitoring tool** that mainly generates alerts and notifications which makes it suitable for monitoring the applications which are running on the Kubernetes clusters. This tool offers a **configuration option** for the notifications and provides a high visibility all across the **APIs**, and other resources.

**Key Features:**

- Prometheus is used to identify irregular traffic clusters and patterns.
- It can collect, and store metrics as **time series data**, recording information with a time stamp.
- This tool also helps in collecting and recording the labels, it also provides monitoring and alerting functionality.

## 4\. K9s-Kubernetes terminal UI

**K9 terminal** is particularly based on the **UI** which helps to view, interact, and manage the clusters. It is a type of **open-source** tool that makes it easier to navigate, manage, and observe the deployed applications in the wild. The users can run this tool in **macOS, windows, and Linux.** This tool is also used to provide a real-time view of the Kubernetes clusters.

**Key Features:**

- Kubernetes offers corresponding commands for interacting with the observed **resources**.
- It also provides **standard cluster management** **commands** such as **logs, restarts, and port** forwards.
- It also provides a **terminal UI** to interact with the Kubernetes clusters.

## 5\. Helm

**Helm** is a type of **kubernetes application** that is used for deployment purposes by offering a package manager for managing the Helm Charts. The charts are packages of **pre-configured Kubernetes resources**. These Helm charts mainly consist of pre-configured Kubernetes resources which enable reproducible builds and easy management of Kubernetes.

**Key Features:**

- **Helm** provides an ability to search through a large collection of **charts** which are stored in the **chart repository**.
- It helps in **automating** the **development**, **configuration**, and **packaging** of **Kubernetes applications**.
- This tool is used for easily managing **deployment** of **complex microservice-based applications**.

## 6\. Kubewatch

**Kubewatch** is a **famous Kubernetes tool** which is also known as **Kubernetes Watcher**. It helps in **monitoring** the **Kubernetes clusters** to detect **resource changes**. It also helps in **tracking** the **Kubernetes events**. It mainly runs the **k8s cluster** for **monitoring** the **resource changes** and **event notifications**. **Kubewatch** is a **Kubernetes watcher** which currently publishes **notifications** to **Slack**

**Key Features:**

- **Kubewatch** is used to send **notifications** to multiple channels such as **Slack**, **Hipchat**, and so on.
- It is used to **monitor** a large range of **Kubernetes events**, **service updates**, and many more.
- It can simply **integrate** into the **existing communication channels**.

## 7\. Loft Labs

**Loft Labs** is another popular platform mainly used for **cost monitoring** with **auto-stopping**. It operates on top of existing **Kubernetes clusters**, allowing for **self-service** and **multi-tenancy deployments**. This tool automatically identifies old or unused **namespaces**. **Loft Labs** integrates its platform with **Ranching** for virtual Kubernetes clusters, simplifying management of physical and virtual clusters.

**Key Features:**

- When **sleep mode** is activated, the system automatically puts such **namespaces** to sleep after a specified period of inactivity.
- It offers **enterprise-grade multi-tenant access control** and **full security**.
- Users can define **quotas** for each team member’s account within the tool.
